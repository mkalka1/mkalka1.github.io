## Welcome to nextgen Portfolio

#### About me

Currently located about 25 miles southwest of Houston, TX, I work for Discover Financial Services, company that owns the Discover Card. While managing enterprise wide programs to make difference within Payment Industry, we deal with the transactional data on the every day basis. This is what motivated me to explore world of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.

With my background in engineering, managing projects by profession and recent exposure to the area of machine learning, I am excited to share my next generation portfolio for you all to explore the power of predictive analytics.
