### About me

Currently located about 25 miles southwest of Houston, TX, I work for Discover Financial Services, company that owns the Discover Card. While managing enterprise wide programs to make difference within Payment Industry, we deal with the transactional data on the every day basis. This is what motivated me to explore world of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.
